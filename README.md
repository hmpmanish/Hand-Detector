# Hand Detector

This project demonstrates a hand detection system using a webcam feed with a combination of front-end (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and back-end (Python with OpenCV). The system captures live video from the webcam, processes it to detect hands, and displays the results.

## Technologies Used

- **Front-End**:
  - HTML
  - CSS
  - JavaScript

- **Back-End**:
  - Python
  - OpenCV (for hand detection)

## Features

- **Webcam Integration**: Captures live video from your webcam.
- **Hand Detection**: Uses OpenCV's Haar Cascade classifier to detect hands in the webcam feed.
- **Real-Time Processing**: Detects and highlights hands in real time with a green rectangle.

## Installation

### Front-End

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to start the webcam feed.

### Back-End (Python)

1. Install Python (if not already installed). You can download it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Install OpenCV by running the following command:

   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python
   Download the pre-trained Haar Cascade XML file for hand detection. You can use a model like aGest.xml (or any available hand classifier). This file is typically included in OpenCV's data folder or can be found in various hand detection repositories online.

Run the hand_detection.py file to start detecting hands from your webcam.

bash
Copy code
python hand_detection.py
Usage
Open the index.html file to see the webcam stream.
The Python script will display real-time video with detected hands highlighted by a green rectangle.
Press q to stop the webcam feed.

Troubleshooting
Webcam not working: Ensure your webcam is properly connected and not being used by another application.
Detection not accurate: The Haar Cascade model used in this example might not detect hands in all conditions (e.g., lighting, angle). Experiment with different models or libraries (e.g., MediaPipe or TensorFlow) for more advanced hand tracking.
